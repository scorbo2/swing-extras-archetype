# If you are building on a linux-based system, and if you have the
# make-installer.sh script installed (from https://github.com/scorbo2/install-scripts),
# this this config will be used to autogenerate an installer tarball for your application.
# This is already wired up in the supplied pom.xml file, so it will run on every maven build.
#
# ALL PATHS ARE RELATIVE TO PROJECT ROOT

# Currently we are limited to "tarball" (.tar.gz) generation.
# In future, may support RPM or DEB package generation.
